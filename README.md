## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Development

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run server
```

2. In another terminal, start the React development server:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Or start both simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

1. Build the React app:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9000`

## Usage

### 1. Upload and Analyze Logs

1. Navigate to the **Log Analysis** tab
2. Upload a ZIP file using the drag-and-drop interface or file browser
3. (Optional) Enter a password if the ZIP file is protected
   - **Note**: The system automatically tries the filename as the password if the file is encrypted
   - Password hierarchy: No password → User-provided password → Filename as password
4. Click **Upload and Analyze** to process the logs

### 2. View Analysis Results

The **Analysis Results** tab shows:
- **Summary Statistics**: Total issues, log level counts, and detected metadata
- **Detected Issues**: List of all identified problems with severity indicators
- **High-Frequency Patterns**: Most common log patterns

Click on any issue to see:
- **Recommended Solutions**: Root cause analysis and step-by-step fix instructions
- **Assignments**: Assign the issue to team members
- **Discussion**: Add comments and collaborate on resolution

### 3. Browse Log Files

The **Files & Logs** tab provides:
- **Directory Tree**: Navigate the original file structure
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficiently view large log files
- **Pattern Highlighting**: Color-coded highlighting of detected issues
- **Search**: Find specific content across all files

### 4. Manage Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge Base** tab allows you to:
- **View Patterns**: Browse all error patterns with severity and type
- **Add Patterns**: Create custom patterns using keywords or regex
- **Manage Solutions**: Add, edit, or delete solutions for patterns
- **Export Knowledge**: Share patterns and solutions with your team

## Default Error Patterns

The tool comes pre-configured with 8 common error patterns:

1. **Fatal Error** (CRITICAL) - Fatal level errors
2. **OutOfMemoryError** (CRITICAL) - Out of memory errors
3. **Segmentation Fault** (CRITICAL) - Segmentation faults
4. **NullPointerException** (HIGH) - Java/Android null pointer exceptions
5. **Stack Overflow** (HIGH) - Stack overflow errors
6. **dyld Symbol Not Found** (HIGH) - Dynamic linker symbol errors
7. **Network Connection Failed** (MEDIUM) - Network connection issues
8. **Permission Denied** (MEDIUM) - File or resource permission errors

Each pattern includes default solutions with root cause analysis and resolution steps.

## Database Schema

The knowledge base uses SQLite with the following tables:

- **patterns**: Error pattern definitions (name, type, value, severity, category)
- **solutions**: Solution library (title, description, root cause, steps)
- **log_analysis**: Analysis history (filename, metadata, stats, status)
- **detected_issues**: Detected problems (pattern, occurrences, sample lines)
- **assignments**: Issue assignments (assigned_to, status, notes)
- **comments**: Discussion threads (author, content, timestamp)

## Performance Considerations

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Log files are rendered using react-window for efficient handling of large files (10,000+ lines)
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex patterns are compiled once and reused
- **Clustering**: Similarity detection uses normalized text for efficient grouping
- **Database**: SQLite provides fast local storage with indexed queries

## Security

- File upload restricted to ZIP files only (validated by MIME type and extension)
- File size limited to 100MB to prevent DOS attacks
- SQL injection prevented through parameterized queries
- No credentials stored in code or configuration files
- CodeQL security scanning: 0 vulnerabilities
