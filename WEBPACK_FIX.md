# Fix for RangeError: Invalid array length in webpack FileSystemInfo

## Problem
The application was experiencing a `RangeError: Invalid array length` error in webpack's FileSystemInfo.js at line 3928. This error occurred during file upload operations and was caused by webpack's file tracking system attempting to handle too many files, causing the internal arrays to exceed JavaScript's maximum array size.

## Root Cause
The error was happening in webpack's symlink processing where `hashes.push(entry.hash)` was called repeatedly, eventually causing the hashes array to become too large.

## Solution
The fix implements webpack optimization configurations to prevent excessive file tracking:

### 1. Environment Variables (.env)
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` - Disables source maps to reduce memory usage
- `FAST_REFRESH=false` - Disables fast refresh to reduce file watching overhead  
- `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` - Skips preflight checks to avoid additional file operations
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` - Increases Node.js memory limit

### 2. CRACO Configuration (craco.config.js)
- **Watch Options**: Configures webpack to ignore large directories and reduce polling frequency
- **Snapshot Configuration**: Limits the number of managed and immutable paths webpack tracks
- **Cache Configuration**: Makes filesystem caching less aggressive with limited memory generations

### 3. Updated Build Scripts
Changed from `react-scripts` to `craco` to enable webpack customization while maintaining Create React App compatibility.

## Files Changed
- `client/.env` - Added environment variables for webpack optimization
- `client/craco.config.js` - Added webpack configuration overrides
- `client/package.json` - Updated scripts to use CRACO
- Added `@craco/craco` as dev dependency

## Testing
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ File upload with 100 files works without issues
- ✅ File upload with 1000 files works without issues
- ✅ No RangeError during webpack operations

## Benefits
- Prevents RangeError during large file operations
- Reduces memory usage during development
- Maintains full functionality while optimizing performance
- No breaking changes to existing features
